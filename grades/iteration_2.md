# Iteration 2 Evaluation - Group 11

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### Features
(Modifications if any are good?  Key and extended features marked as was required in the assignment?)
All good here. No modifications and everything seems on track.

### UI sketches
(Improved as either needed or required based on iteration 1 feedback?)

UI sketches are good and no changes are requried yet.

### Endpoint and/or other interface documentation
(Complete relative to UI sketches, UML, etc?  JSON in/out shown?  Error code cases shown?)

Endpoints seem good. I like that you started to think about privacy when handling sensitive data, in particular, by letting the API receive passwords hashes instead of plain-text. Unfortunately, this is a bad idea, and weâ€™ll discuss why in the lab.

### UML Class diagram
(Good coverage of design?  Proper use of whole-part diamonds, associations, multiplicities, etc?  Actions in app mapped to methods?)

UML looks good. It shows us that you've thought about your actions and the methods associated with them which is a good thing.

### Architecture
(Revisions if any are good/appropriate?  Described well and pictured if it is not standard?)

Architecture is good but you still haven't taken your SIS key and prototyped sending requests using the key to see if all your use cases will work. 

(-5 Point)

### Initial code
(Challenging libraries prototyped?  Server stood up and some basic code written?  Frontend prototyped? 100+ lines of original code, not just pasting in a tutorial?)

I can see some frontend and some backend code which is a good sign!

#### Initial commit made
(did every group member commit at least once to the repo as was required in the assignment?)

2 members didn't commit even once : Matthew and Emily but Emily was excused, so I'll not deduct marks for her.

(-5 Point)

### Other General Remarks

Good progress but you need to get the SIS key and prototype to figure out if that solves all your usecases.

**Grade: 90/100**
