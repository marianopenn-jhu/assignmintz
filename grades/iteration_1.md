## Iteration 1 Evaluation - Group 11

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### The project idea 
(Too easy or too difficult? A coherent application?)

Keeping track of all the courses using piazza, Blackboard and course websites has been a personal problem with me. So, I'm pretty excited about your project! 

### Features
(Do features align with vision, UI sketches, and use-cases? Are there non-CRUD features?)

You have a god set of features. We did have some ideas though:

1) You can also give an option to schedule TA Hours online something like scheduling a room in BLC.
2) Private discussions/feedbacks to the intructors can also be a great feature to include

You also need to add some NON-CRUD features as your project seems to lack that at the moment

(-2 Points)
### UI sketches
(Complete with respect to features? Realistic visions of the app that have "real fake" data in them?)

Sketches seem to fulfil the requirements but you need to go through them to make a more realistic version that shows actual UI elements that can be used on a website. I recommend that you use proto.io for doing that. Also go ahead and work on a flow diagram that showcases the website and it's various states. Looking forward to this till the next iteration

(-1 points)

### Use Cases
(Are all important multi-step actions not clear from the UI sketches presented in use-cases?)

All use cases are pretty clear. 

### Architecture
(Are the choices realistic? Is serious prototyping work needed to ensure the app is feasible?)

All good here.

### General Remarks

Great idea! Looking forward to it! Just see to it that the user experence is good since that's what you'r trying to improve with this app.
