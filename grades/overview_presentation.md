OOSE Project Overview Presentation Evaluation
---------------------------------------------
**Group 11**

**Evaluator: [Facchinetti, Leandro](mailto:lfacchi2@jhu.edu)**

### Attendance and contribution

All good.

### Overview of project

All good.

### Demo

The screens look good, but I’d like to have seen at least one non-trivial feature integrated between back-end and front-end.

### Architecture

All good.

### Code review

All good.

### Presentation organization

All good.

### Talking

All good.

### Quality of slides

Good job, particularly with the UML diagram.

### Project comments emerging during the talk

Your concrete plans for the **intelligence** behind the most interesting features seem vague. Once you have the data, what algorithms do you plan on using to mine it, for example?

I’m also concerned with the ergonomics around data input. For example, do you need users to go to your app and tell how much time they spent on each assignment? Or do you plan to integrate with time tracking tools?
