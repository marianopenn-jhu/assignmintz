# Iteration 3 Evaluation - Group 11

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
(Dev stack all stood up, and a few core features working?  Basic demo running?  Some progress on non-CRUD features?)

All good here!

### Design check-in
(Is the project on-track in terms of the evolved design?  It is still a good amount of work given how it has evolved?  Are there flaws emerging in the design, or features that should be added or removed?)

Looks good!

### Code Quality
(Good file structure?  Good use of object-oriented design principles thus far in the codebase?  Correct use of frameworks?  Are there other frameworks or tools you should be using that you are not now?)
 
Looks good!

### Git usage
(Group members are all being good about regular commits, use of branches, pull requests, etc?  All members contributing well?)

Git usage, in general, is good but two of your teammates has contributed significantly less. I would really like to see more commits from Harry and Emily.

#### Use of the GitHub issue tracker to manage bugs, features, etc.

All good here! A suggestion though: Instead of categorizing issues by adding prefixes to the title, you can use labels.

#### Codebase pushed to master on your team's GitHub repository for our inspection

Looks good!

### Iteration submission and reporting

Looks good!

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
(Could we successfully build the project from the README alone?)

I could not get the app to work after following your README instructions. I have also added an issue for this. Please get it fixed. 

(-10 points)

#### Top-level file CHANGELOG.md present in your repo and describes progress in this iteration well

All good here!

#### Use of GitHub's project boards to keep track of your progress
(You need to have a column for each iteration and to have sketched out what future iteration you are going to implement the various features.  You need to have very clear goals for the next iteration (4).  Also, any features not implemented in iteration 3 need to be moved to iteration 4.  You need to have at least some features penciled in for iterations 5 and 6.)

Looks good!

### Other Remarks


**Grade: 90/100**
