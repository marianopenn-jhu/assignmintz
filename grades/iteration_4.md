# Iteration 4 Evaluation - Group 11

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
[25 points] (More features working?  Improved demo running?  Good progress on non-CRUD including some integration? Project is looking to have appropriate degree of difficulty overall?)

All good. You need to work on integrating your backend with the frontend. I see a lot of code that's not being used currently.

#### Code Quality
[10 points] (Good file structure?  Good use of object-oriented design principles thus far in codebase?  Correct use of frameworks?  Are there other frameworks or tools you should be using that you are not now?)

Overall the structure seems okay but I think you can do better. Try improving the README as well. 

### Testing
[20 points] (A fully functioning test harness using good code methodology in terms of test setup and tear-down?)

You seemed to have missed adding the tear down methods. You should always restore the system back and clear everything you used for running the tests in the tear down method.

(-3 points)

#### Test coverage
[10 points] Good coverage with tests?

All good here. 

#### Travis
[5 points] (Travis-CI integration tests working?  Tests are at integration level?)

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points]

All good here. Consider adding a travis batch to your README.

### Deployment
[5 points] (Server deployed on Heroku or AWS or other?)

Deployment doesn't really work right now. You should try fixing it ASAP.

### Advanced Git usage
[10 points] (Still being good about regular commits, pull requests, etc?  Additionally, development primarily taking place on feature branches, no personal-named branches, good git workflow overall?)

You guys aren't making pull requests. You should make a new feature branch, commit to it and then create a PR to master. Apart from that everything looks fine.

(-3 points)


### Iteration submission and reporting

In future, you should document what you've done for each iteration. 

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iterations 5 and 6
[10 points]

Changelog isn't being updated after iteration 3. Please do keep it updated.
