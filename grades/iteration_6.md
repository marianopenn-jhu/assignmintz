# Iteration 6 Evaluation - Group 11 AssignMintz

### Presentation
(Was the presentation itself done well - was it well-organized, easy to understand, and convincing?)

Show how the app works in a demo, no need to have slides on it as well.

You had glitches in UML slide multipliciies and diamonds on your diagram

Your app doesn't work in other browsers, and there is no login error message for wrong password etc.

It is good to keep presentations at an even keel. There was no particular need to do a deep dive in to react early on in the presentation.


#### App demo
(Did app work well?  Did any errors arise during the demo?  How did the demo'd implementation line up with features proposed?)

Fine.

#### UI quality based on the demo
(Was it well-designed? Was it usable?  Did it have glitches?)

Your UI was working but somewhat bare-bones.  For example the time box - it was a very big box to type in hours and was not labeled as such - hours? minutes? days?.

### Testing and Coverage
(Continue to write more tests for new features and keep high coverage?)

Testing coverage is good.

### Build and Deployment and git usage
(Same as previous iterations)

You've maintained this well throughout.

### Non-CRUD feature
(How did it turn out?)

You have a leaderboard - the code is in the back end but not in the front-end.  You also had the authorization and authentication classes which you wrote from scratch.  Overrall this is a little light on non-CRUD code.

### Iteration progress reporting
(Final CHANGELOG.md and project boards updated?)

You forgot to update the changelog for the final iteration - Manan

### Evaluation of project difficulty
(in terms of lines of code, conceptual difficulty, non-CRUD features, degree of completion)

Having done a similar project myself (Manan) I know it's not easy to make such a comprehensive application and even more difficult with modern frameworks like Django, Rails.

### Overall Remarks

Your team had to learn a lot of tech for this project and were probably overly ambitious in that regard.  But on the good side you learned a lot!  You didn't get to the full final goal, you are still at alpha with some features missing.

**Grade: 87/100**
