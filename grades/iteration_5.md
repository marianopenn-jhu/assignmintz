# Iteration 5 Evaluation - Group 11

**Evaluator: [Wason, Manan](mailto:mwason1@jhu.edu)**

### Implementation progress
[25 points] (Core app working including non-CRUD integration?  Features filling out?  UI starting to look good even though it still may have some glitches?)

Right now the demo isn't working. Lots of bugs! I'm not even able to perform basic CRUD features. UI can also be improved. The main thing for you to nail is the CRUD functions integrated into the UI, as I have been saying in the past 1-2 labs.

(-15 points)

**Edit**

(-7.5 points)

#### Code Quality
[30 points] (Good use of object-oriented design principles in codebase?  Absence of smells in code?)

I really don't see a whole lot of code for the final iteration. I don't think a lot of your API endpoints from the documentation aren't working. Apart from that the code that you have is okay.

### Testing and Coverage
[20 points] (Continue to write more tests for new features and improve coverage?)

I don't see a whole tests as well. You need to write some tests asap. Some ideas for tests: Course creation validation, user validation, assignment validation etc.

#### Fully automated build of your project with a README.md describing how to build it
[5 points] (Same as previous iteration)

Looks good!

### Deployment
[5 points] (Same as previous iteration)

Looks good!

### Advanced Git usage
[10 points] (Same as previous iteration)

Looks good!

### Iteration submission and reporting

#### CHANGELOG.md updated and project boards updated, filling in goals for iteration 6
[10 points]

Looks good!

### Other Remarks

You need to get done with CRUD API's and UI integrated asap.

**Grade: 87.5/100**
